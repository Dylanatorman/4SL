**4StudentLives (4SL) – Comprehensive Investor Dossier**

---

### Executive Overview

4StudentLives (4SL) is a digital suicide risk and behavioral threat assessment management platform engineered for K–12 schools. It replaces the disjointed, paper-based systems currently used to track student threats and suicide risks—systems that routinely fail to identify patterns of danger, fail to meet state mandates, and leave school districts legally and morally exposed. 4SL transforms this outdated process into a single, compliant digital workflow where multidisciplinary teams can identify, evaluate, document, and manage high-risk students through every stage of intervention.

Our mission is straightforward: to become the national backbone of school safety and accountability. In an era where one missed signal can cost lives and millions in legal damages, 4StudentLives provides a structured, transparent, and defensible process that ensures no student concern goes unseen and no district is left unprotected.

Deployed across six districts serving thousands of students, 4SL is positioned at the intersection of three converging realities:

1. A youth mental health crisis of unprecedented scale.
2. Accelerating legal and regulatory demands for proactive threat assessment systems.
3. Escalating financial liability for failure to act on warning signs.

The convergence of these forces is creating a new market necessity: **digital compliance infrastructure for school safety.**

### The Crisis: A System Failing Its Students

The need for effective, data-driven risk management in schools is no longer theoretical—it’s urgent.

* **Youth Suicide Epidemic:** Nearly **20% of high school students seriously considered suicide** in the past year (CDC, 2023). Suicide is now the **second leading cause of death** among young people aged 10–24.
* **Rising Violence:** School shootings have surged from fewer than 50 incidents in 2013 to **more than 300 in 2023** (Everytown Research). Many of these incidents had identifiable precursors—students exhibiting violent ideation, depression, or threats that were never formally assessed.
* **Financial Impact:** Lawsuit payouts against districts for safety negligence have escalated dramatically: $18 million (Marysville, WA, 2014), $25 million (Parkland, FL, 2018), and $11 million (Virginia Tech, VA, 2007). Each case underscores the cost of inadequate or nonexistent threat assessment procedures.

Every tragedy has one common thread: **missed warning signs.** School staff often notice concerning behaviors but lack a centralized, compliant process to record and escalate them. Paper forms, isolated emails, and informal meetings result in critical data being lost or ignored. The result is preventable violence, preventable suicides, and avoidable liability.

**Graph 1:** *School Shootings, 2013–2023* — incidents up more than 600% in ten years.
**Graph 2:** *Youth Suicide Rate, 2011–2021* — up 38% in a decade (CDC NVSS data).

### The Legal and Regulatory Shift

Schools across the U.S. are being legally compelled to implement behavioral threat assessment programs—and to document their actions in ways that can withstand public and legal scrutiny.

#### California – The Emerging Standard

* **Senate Bill 906 (2022):** Requires school officials to report any homicidal threat to law enforcement, which must immediately conduct a threat assessment. Schools are expected to maintain documented procedures and multidisciplinary coordination.
* **Pending SAFE Act (SB 1241):** Would mandate every middle and high school to establish a multidisciplinary threat assessment team by July 2027. Teams must receive certified training, and each school must maintain a digital record of assessments and outcomes as well as a 24/7 anonymous reporting line. The bill mirrors the structure 4SL already provides.

#### Other State Mandates

* **Florida:** The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act (2018) requires every school to establish a threat assessment team and use a **state-approved threat assessment tool (CSTAG)**. Florida’s Department of Education provides model documentation that parallels 4SL’s digital workflow.
* **Texas:** Following the 2019 Santa Fe shooting, Texas law now mandates behavioral threat assessment teams for all public schools.
* **Virginia:** The first state to require threat assessment teams in K–12 (2013), creating the template for federal guidance.
* **Maryland, Illinois, Kentucky, Washington, Pennsylvania, and others** have followed with similar mandates, all requiring formalized documentation, data retention, and multidisciplinary coordination.

This is not a passing trend—it is the future baseline for compliance. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service have both formally recommended that every district implement behavioral threat assessment and management programs consistent with these state models.

### The Accountability Gap

Legal precedent is setting a clear message: failure to identify and document threats can expose schools to crippling liability. In *Cleveland v. Taft Union High School District* (California, 2022), a jury found the district partially liable for failing to act on warning signs that preceded a school shooting—ultimately awarding **$2 million** to the victim. The court concluded the school had a duty to follow established safety procedures and involve law enforcement but failed to do so. In Florida, the Parkland settlement resulted in **$25 million** paid by the school board and another **$127.5 million** by the federal government for missed intervention opportunities. Similar cases are emerging across the country.

This liability environment is changing behavior. Districts are actively seeking documented compliance systems that prove due diligence in real time—a need that paper systems cannot meet.

### 4StudentLives: From Compliance Burden to Compliance Backbone

4StudentLives was designed to operationalize compliance with state and federal mandates. It doesn’t merely digitize forms—it structures the entire workflow from first report to final resolution.

**Core Capabilities:**

1. **Digitized Threat and Suicide Risk Assessments:** Standardized templates ensure every incident is evaluated using evidence-based protocols consistent with CSTAG, SB 906, and other state requirements.
2. **Multidisciplinary Coordination:** Enables seamless collaboration between administrators, counselors, psychologists, and law enforcement, as required by California and Florida statutes.
3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every step is logged and time-stamped, creating a defensible record for audits, investigations, or legal review.
4. **Accountability Dashboard:** Leadership can view open cases, response times, and follow-up outcomes to verify compliance and identify gaps.
5. **Training Integration:** Built-in support for documenting staff training and readiness, meeting statutory requirements for educator preparedness.

> “A standardized platform ensures no concern falls through the cracks and that the school meets mandates (like training staff to recognize warning signs and having clear protocols to respond).”

4SL transforms fragmented compliance obligations into a unified process. Districts using 4SL can demonstrate both proactive prevention and documented adherence to the law.

### Competitive Landscape

The current safety tech market includes companies such as Navigate360, STOPit, and Raptor Technologies. These platforms address adjacent functions—anonymous reporting, incident management, or emergency response—but none deliver full alignment with state threat assessment mandates or suicide risk workflows.

* **Navigate360:** Offers broad school safety tools but limited customization for state-mandated assessment frameworks.
* **STOPit Solutions:** Focuses on anonymous reporting and digital tip management but lacks full assessment workflow integration.
* **Raptor Technologies:** Provides visitor and emergency management software, with partial behavioral threat modules.

4StudentLives fills the compliance gap. It is the first solution designed specifically to help schools **comply with state law, standardize documentation, and prevent liability** through end-to-end digital case management.
