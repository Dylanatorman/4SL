This renewal is more than a continuation—it's a clear affirmation of the strong impression you've made as CEO and the tremendous value 4StudentLives continues to bring to the field.\n\nThroughout this past year, your leadership has stood out. County superintendents and LEAs alike have expressed genuine enthusiasm about working with you and your team. Many have noted how your deep understanding of the challenges schools face—particularly when it comes to student safety and mental health—has made you a trusted and respected partner.\n\nThe desire for a secure, online platform to conduct threat assessments has only grown. LEAs are increasingly seeking tools that not only meet compliance requirements but also provide a streamlined, proactive approach to supporting school safety. 4StudentLives is clearly answering that call.\n\nSeveral county superintendents have expressed eagerness to engage with 4SL in the development of a school-centered platform—one that reflects a deep understanding of the practical realities educators face. The alignment between the missions of our two organizations has never been more evident. Together, we share a deep commitment to supporting student well-being as foundational to their academic success and life outcomes.\n\nWith your continued leadership, we are confident that this renewed partnership will open new pathways for LEAs across the state to access the systems they need to keep students safe and supported. We look forward to working with you to expand access to this vital resource and to building on the strong momentum we've created together."
